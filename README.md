# incredimail-converter-reynardware

This version of Incredimail Converter is derived from the original developed by Reynardware (and specifically David P. Owczarski) in 2009-2010. I am adapting it to deal with Incredimail 2.5's database format, which no longer uses .imm files but rather stores messages individually as .iml files. This version is independently developed and not endorsed by Reynardware. However I am very grateful for their releasing the code under a friendly license (the Mozilla Public License) thus saving me much effort!

The original author's site can be found at <https://code.google.com/archive/p/incredimail-converter-reynardware/> and his blog is at <http://reynardware.blogspot.co.uk/>

[This site](http://www.systoolsgroup.com/forensics/incredimail/) provided much useful insight into how the database is set up. It suggests that the IMM / IML file distinction specifically applies to Windows XP vs. later operating systems, so it's possible the original Reynardware converter is good for anyone stuck on XP, but for anything later you might need my version.
